This page contains links to the slides and code from my talk "Reinventing the Transaction Script".

Here's the blurb for the talk:


> The Transaction Script pattern organizes business logic as a single procedure. It has always been considered less sophisticated and flexible than a layered architecture with a rich domain model. But is that really true? \ \ In this talk, we'll reinvent the Transaction Script using functional programming principles. We'll see that we can still do domain-driven design, and still have code which is decoupled and reusable, all while preserving the simplicity and productivity of the original one-script-per-workflow approach.
