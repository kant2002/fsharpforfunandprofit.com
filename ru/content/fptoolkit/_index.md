This page contains links to the slides and code from my talk "The Functional Programmer's Toolkit".

Here's the blurb for the talk:

> The functional programming community has a number of patterns with strange names such as monads, monoids, functors, and catamorphisms.\ \ In this beginner-friendly talk, we'll demystify these techniques and see how they all fit together into a small but versatile "tool kit".\ \ We'll then see how the tools in this tool kit can be applied to a wide variety of programming problems, such as handling missing data, working with lists, and implementing the functional equivalent of dependency injection.
