This page contains links to the slides and code from my talk "Pipeline-oriented Programming".

Here's the blurb for the talk:


> Passing data through a pipeline of transformations is an alternative approach to classic OOP.  The LINQ methods in .NET are designed around this, but the pipeline approach can be used for so much more than manipulating collections. \ \ In this talk, I'll look at pipeline-oriented programming and how it relates to functional programming, the open-closed principle, unit testing, the onion architecture, and more. I'll finish up by showing how you can build a complete web app using only this approach.
