This page contains links to the slides and code from my talk "Functional Programming Design Patterns". **Over [160,000 views on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8I19uA-wGY)!**

Here's the blurb:

> In object-oriented development, we are all familiar with design patterns such as the Strategy pattern and Decorator pattern, and design principles such as SOLID.\ \ The functional programming community has design patterns and principles as well.\ \ This talk will provide an overview of some of these, and present some demonstrations of FP design in practice.


## Videos

Below is the video recorded at NDC London 2014 (click image to view video). It's an hour long and I whiz through as fast as I can!

I did the same talk at the London F# Meetup in January, 2015. This time, there were questions during the talk, and I went a bit slower. As a result, it's about two hours long!

## Twitterstorm!

After I did this talk at BuildStuff 2014, one particular slide got retweeted a lot.

Alas, it got misinterpreted by both the pro-FP and anti-FP people!

Even Uncle Bob [wrote a post about it](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/11/24/FPvsOO.html)!

Oh dear! Humor doesn't work out of context. So in the NDC and Skills Matter version of the talk I decided to make it clearer that I was making fun of FP people who live in an ivory tower:

Hope you enjoy the talk!
