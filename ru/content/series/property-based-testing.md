This series of posts will introduce you to the fundamentals of property-based testing: how it is different from traditional example-based testing, why it is important, and how to work with properties in theory and practice.

A follow-up series is available too: [The Return of the Enterprise Developer From Hell](/series/return-of-the-edfh).

There is also a talk on property-based testing based on these posts. [Slides and video here](/pbt/).
