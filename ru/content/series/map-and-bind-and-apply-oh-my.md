In this series of posts, I'll attempt to describe some of the core functions for dealing with generic data types (such as `Option` and `List`). This is a follow-up post to [my talk on functional patterns](/fppatterns/).

Yes, I know that [I promised not to do this kind of thing](/posts/why-i-wont-be-writing-a-monad-tutorial/), but for this post I thought I'd take a different approach from most people. Rather than talking about abstractions such as type classes, I thought it might be useful to focus on the core functions themselves and how they are used in practice.

In other words, a sort of "man page" for `map`, `return`, `apply`, and `bind`.

So, there is a section for each function, describing their name (and common aliases), common operators, their type signature, and then a detailed description of why they are needed and how they are used, along with some visuals (which I always find helpful).
