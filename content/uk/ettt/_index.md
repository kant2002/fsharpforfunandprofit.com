This page contains links to the slides and code from my talk "Enterprise Tic-Tac-Toe".

Here's the blurb for the talk:


> Follow along as I ridiculously over-engineer a simple game to demonstrate how   functional programming can be used to create a real-world "enterprise-ready" application.\
  \ Topics covered include: encoding business rules into types, data hiding with parametric polymorphism, using functions for capability-based security, exposing a REST API with HATEAOS, the functional approach to logging, actors, scalability and more.

This talk is based on my blog posts on this topic:
