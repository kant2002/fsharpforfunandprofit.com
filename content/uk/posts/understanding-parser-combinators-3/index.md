*UPDATE: [Slides and video from my talk on this topic](/parser/)*

In this series, we are looking at how applicative parsers and parser combinators work.

* In the [first post](/posts/understanding-parser-combinators/), we created the foundations of a parsing library.
* In the [second post](/posts/understanding-parser-combinators-2/), we built out the library with many other useful combinators.
* In this post, we'll rework the library to provide more helpful error messages.

----

## 1. Labelling a Parser

In some of the failing code examples from earlier posts, we got confusing errors:

```fsharp {src=#ConfusingErrors}
let parseDigit = anyOf ['0'..'9']
run parseDigit "|ABC"  // Failure "Expecting '9'. Got '|'"
```

`parseDigit` is defined as a choice of digit characters, so when the last choice (`'9'`) fails, that is the error message we receive.

But that message is quite confusing. What we *really* want is to receive is an error that mentions "digit", something like: `Failure "Expecting digit. Got '|'"`.

That is, what we need is a way of labeling parsers with a word like "digit" and then showing that label when a failure occurs.

As a reminder, this is how the `Parser` type was defined in earlier posts:

```fsharp {src=#Parser_v1}
/// Type that wraps a parsing function
type Parser<'T> = Parser of (string -> ParseResult<'T * string>)
```

In order to add a label, we need to change it into a record structure:

```fsharp {src=#Parser_labelled}
type ParserLabel = string

/// A Parser structure has a parsing function & label
type Parser<'a> = {
  parseFn : (string -> ParseResult<'a * string>)
  label:  ParserLabel
  }
```

The record contains two fields: the parsing function (`parseFn`) and the `label`.

One problem is that the label is in the parser itself, but not in the `Result`, which means that clients will not know how to display the label along with the error.

So let's add it to the `Failure` case of `Result` as well, in addition to the error message:

```fsharp {src=#Failure_labelled}
// Aliases
type ParserLabel = string
type ParserError = string

type ParseResult<'a> =
  | Success of 'a
  | Failure of ParserLabel * ParserError
```

And while we are at it, let's define a helper function to display the result of a parse:

```fsharp {src=#printResult}
let printResult result =
  match result with
  | Success (value,_input) ->
    printfn "%A" value
  | Failure (label,error) ->
    printfn "Error parsing %s\n%s" label error
```

### Updating the code

With this change to the definition of `Parser` and `Result`, we have to change some of the basic functions, such as `run`:

```fsharp {src=#run_labelled}
/// Run a parser with some input
let run (parser:Parser<_>) input =
  // call inner function with input
  parser.parseFn input
```

and `bindP`:

```fsharp {src=#bindP_labelled}
/// "bindP" takes a parser-producing function f, and a parser p
/// and passes the output of p into f, to create a new parser
let bindP f p =
  let label = "unknown"           // <== changed
  let innerFn input =
    let result1 = run p input
    match result1 with
    | Failure (label,err) ->    // <== changed
      // return failure from parser1
      Failure (label,err)
    | Success (value1,remainingInput) ->
      // apply f to get a new parser
      let p2 = f value1
      // run parser with remaining input
      run p2 remainingInput
  {parseFn=innerFn; label=label}  // <== changed
```

We have to make similar changes to `returnP`, `orElse`, and `many`.  For the complete code, see the link at the bottom of this post.

### Updating the label

When we use a combinator to build a new compound parser, we will often want to assign a new label to it. In order to do this, we replace the original `Parser` with another one that returns the new label.

Here's the code:

```fsharp {src=#setLabel}
/// Update the label in the parser
let setLabel parser newLabel =
  // change the inner function to use the new label
  let newInnerFn input =
    let result = parser.parseFn input
    match result with
    | Success s ->
      // if Success, do nothing
      Success s
    | Failure (oldLabel,err) ->
      // if Failure, return new label
      Failure (newLabel,err)        // <====== use newLabel here
  // return the Parser
  {parseFn=newInnerFn; label=newLabel}  // <====== use newLabel here
```

And let's create an infix version of this called `<?>`:

```fsharp  {src=#setLabel_op}
/// infix version of setLabel
let ( <?> ) = setLabel
```

And sometimes it's convenient to get the label too:

```fsharp  {src=#getLabel}
/// get the label from a parser
let getLabel parser =
  // get label
  parser.label
```

Let's test our new toy!

```fsharp {src=#setLabel_test}
let parseDigit_WithLabel =
  anyOf ['0'..'9']
  <?> "digit"

run parseDigit_WithLabel "|ABC"
|> printResult
```

And the output is:

```text {src=#setLabel_test_out}
Error parsing digit
Unexpected '|'
```

The error message is now `Error parsing digit` rather than `Expecting '9'`. Much better!

### Setting default labels:

We can also set the default labels for certain combinators such as `andThen` and `orElse` based on the inputs:

```fsharp {src=#andThen_labelled}
/// Combine two parsers as "A andThen B"
let andThen p1 p2 =
  let label = sprintf "%s andThen %s" (getLabel p1) (getLabel p2)
  p1 >>= (fun p1Result ->
  p2 >>= (fun p2Result ->
    returnP (p1Result,p2Result) ))
  <?> label     // <====== provide a default label
```

```fsharp {src=#orElse_labelled}
/// Combine two parsers as "A orElse B"
let orElse parser1 parser2 =
  // construct a new label
  let label =  // <====== provide a default label
    sprintf "%s orElse %s" (getLabel parser1) (getLabel parser2)

  let innerFn input =
    //etc
```

```fsharp {src=#anyOf_labelled}
/// Choose any of a list of characters
let anyOf listOfChars =
  let label = sprintf "any of %A" listOfChars
  listOfChars
  |> List.map pchar // convert into parsers
  |> choice
  <?> label         // <====== provide a default label
```

----

## 2. Replacing "pchar" with "satisfy"

One thing that has bothered me about all the implementations so far is `pchar`, the basic primitive that all the other functions have built on.

I don't like that it is so tightly coupled to the input model. What happens if we want to parse bytes from a binary format, or other kinds of input. All the combinators other than `pchar` are loosely coupled. If we could decouple `pchar` as well, we would be set up for parsing *any* stream of tokens, and that would make me happy!

At this point, I'll repeat one of my favorite FP slogans: "parameterize all the things!" In the case of `pchar`, we'll remove the `charToMatch` parameter and replace it with a function -- a predicate. We'll call the new function `satisfy`:

```fsharp {src=#satisfy}
/// Match an input token if the predicate is satisfied
let satisfy predicate label =
  let innerFn input =
    if String.IsNullOrEmpty(input) then
      Failure (label,"No more input")
    else
      let first = input.[0]
      if predicate first then      // <====== use predicate here
        let remainingInput = input.[1..]
        Success (first,remainingInput)
      else
        let err = sprintf "Unexpected '%c'" first
        Failure (label,err)
  // return the parser
  {parseFn=innerFn;label=label}
```

Other than the parameters, the only thing that has changed from the `pchar` implementation is this one line:

```fsharp {src=#none}
let satisfy predicate label =
    ...
    if predicate first then
    ...
```

With `satisfy` available, we can rewrite `pchar`:

```fsharp {src=#pchar_satisfy}
/// parse a char
let pchar charToMatch =
  let predicate ch = (ch = charToMatch)
  let label = sprintf "%c" charToMatch
  satisfy predicate label
```

Note that we are setting the label to be the `charToMatch`. This refactoring would not have been as convenient before, because we didn't have the concept of "labels" yet, and so `pchar` would not have been able to return a useful error message.

The `satisfy` function also lets us write more efficient versions of other parsers. For example, parsing a digit looked like this originally:

```fsharp  {src=#digitChar_anyof}
/// parse a digit
let digitChar =
  anyOf ['0'..'9']
```

But now we can rewrite it using a predicate directly, making it a lot more efficient:

```fsharp {src=#digitChar_satisfy}
/// parse a digit
let digitChar =
  let predicate = Char.IsDigit
  let label = "digit"
  satisfy predicate label
```

Similarly, we can create a more efficient whitespace parser too:

```fsharp {src=#whitespaceChar_satisfy}
/// parse a whitespace char
let whitespaceChar =
  let predicate = Char.IsWhiteSpace
  let label = "whitespace"
  satisfy predicate label
```

## 3. Adding position and context to error messages

Another way to improve the error messages is to show the line and column that the error occurred on.

Obviously, for simple one-liners, keeping track of the error location is not a problem, but when you are parsing a 100 line JSON file, it will be very helpful.

In order to track the line and column we are going to have to abandon the simple `string` input and replace it with something more complex, so let's start with that.

### Defining a input that tracks position

First, we will need a `Position` type to store the line and column, with helper functions to increment one column and one line:

```fsharp {src=#Position}
type Position = {
  line : int
  column : int
}

/// define an initial position
let initialPos = {line=0; column=0}

/// increment the column number
let incrCol (pos:Position) =
  {pos with column=pos.column + 1}

/// increment the line number and set the column to 0
let incrLine pos =
  {line=pos.line + 1; column=0}
```

Next, we'll need to combine the input string and current position into a single "input state" type.  Since we are line oriented, we can make our lives easier and store the input string as a array of lines rather than as one giant string:

```fsharp {src=#InputState}
/// Define the current input state
type InputState = {
  lines : string[]
  position : Position
}
```

We will also need a way to convert a string into a initial `InputState`:

```fsharp {src=#fromStr}
module InputState =
  /// Create a new InputState from a string
  let fromStr str =
    if String.IsNullOrEmpty(str) then
      {lines=[||]; position=initialPos}
    else
      let separators = [| "\r\n"; "\n" |]
      let lines = str.Split(separators, StringSplitOptions.None)
      {lines=lines; position=initialPos}
```
*Note, we'll put all the functions like `fromStr` in an `InputState` module for convenience.*

Now, in order to consumer input for the parser, we can no longer just read characters from a string. Instead, we are reading characters from the `InputState` and also updating the position as we go. We will need a new function for this -- let's call it `nextChar`.

We know what the input for `nextChar` will be (an `InputState`) but what should the output look like?

* If the input is at the end, we need a way to indicate that there is no next character, so in that case return `None`.
* Therefore in the case when a character is available, we will return `Some`.
* In addition, the input state will have changed because the column (or line) will have been incremented as well.

So, putting this together, the input for `nextChar` is an `InputState` and the output is a pair `char option * InputState`.

The logic for returning the next char will be as follows then:

* If we are at the last character of the input, return EOF (`None`) and don't change the state.
* If the current column is *not* at the end of a line, return the character at that position and change the state by incrementing the column position.
* If the current column *is* at the end of a line, return a newline character and change the state by incrementing the line position.

Here's the code:

```fsharp {src=#nextChar}
// return the current line
let currentLine inputState =
  let linePos = inputState.position.line
  if linePos < inputState.lines.Length then
    inputState.lines.[linePos]
  else
    "end of file"

/// Get the next character from the input, if any
/// else return None. Also return the updated InputState
/// Signature: InputState -> InputState * char option
let nextChar input =
  let linePos = input.position.line
  let colPos = input.position.column
  // three cases
  // 1) if line >= maxLine ->
  //       return EOF
  // 2) if col less than line length ->
  //       return char at colPos, increment colPos
  // 3) if col at line length ->
  //       return NewLine, increment linePos

  if linePos >= input.lines.Length then
    input, None
  else
    let currentLine = currentLine input
    if colPos < currentLine.Length then
      let char = currentLine.[colPos]
      let newPos = incrCol input.position
      let newState = {input with position=newPos}
      newState, Some char
    else
      // end of line, so return LF and move to next line
      let char = '\n'
      let newPos = incrLine input.position
      let newState = {input with position=newPos}
      newState, Some char
```

Unlike the earlier `string` implementation, the underlying array of lines is never altered or copied -- only the position is changed. This means that making a new state each time the position changes should be reasonably efficient, because the same array holding the text is shared everywhere.

Let's quickly test that the implementation works. We'll create a helper function `readAllChars` and then see what it returns for different inputs:

```fsharp {src=#readAllChars}
let rec readAllChars input =
  [
    let remainingInput,charOpt = InputState.nextChar input
    match charOpt with
    | None ->
      // end of input
      ()
    | Some ch ->
      // return first character
      yield ch
      // return the remaining characters
      yield! readAllChars remainingInput
  ]
```

Here it is with some example inputs:

```fsharp {src=#readAllChars_test}
InputState.fromStr "" |> readAllChars
  //=> []
InputState.fromStr "a" |> readAllChars
  //=> ['a'; '\010']
InputState.fromStr "ab" |> readAllChars
  //=> ['a'; 'b'; '\010']
InputState.fromStr "a\nb" |> readAllChars
  //=> ['a'; '\010'; 'b'; '\010']
```

Note that the implementation returns a newline at the end of the input, even if the input doesn't have one. I think that this is a feature, not a bug!

### Changing the parser to use the new input type

We now need to change the `Parser` type yet again, this time, to work with new input type.

To start with, the `Failure` case needs to return some kind of data that indicates the position, so we can show it in an error message. We could just use the `InputState` as is, but let's be good and define a new type specially for this use, called `ParserPosition`:

```fsharp {src=#ParserPosition}
/// Stores information about the parser position for error messages
type ParserPosition = {
  currentLine : string
  line : int
  column : int
  }
```

We'll need some way to convert a `InputState` into a `ParserPosition`:

```fsharp {src=#parserPositionFromInputState}
let parserPositionFromInputState (inputState:InputState) = {
  currentLine = InputState.currentLine inputState
  line = inputState.position.line
  column = inputState.position.column
  }
```

And finally, we can update the `ParseResult` type to include `ParserPosition`:

```fsharp {src=#ParseResult_withPosition}
type ParseResult<'a> =
  | Success of 'a
  | Failure of ParserLabel * ParserError * ParserPosition
```

In addition, the `Parser` type needs to change from `string` to `InputState`:

```fsharp {src=#Parser_withPosition}
/// A Parser structure has a parsing function & label
type Parser<'a> = {
  parseFn : (InputState -> ParseResult<'a * InputState>)
  label:  ParserLabel
  }
```

With all this extra information available, the `printResult` function can be enhanced to print the text of the current line, along with a caret where the error is:

```fsharp {src=#printResult_withPosition}
let printResult result =
  match result with
  | Success (value,input) ->
    printfn "%A" value
  | Failure (label,error,parserPos) ->
    let errorLine = parserPos.currentLine
    let colPos = parserPos.column
    let linePos = parserPos.line
    let failureCaret = sprintf "%*s^%s" colPos "" error
    printfn "Line:%i Col:%i Error parsing %s\n%s\n%s" linePos colPos label errorLine failureCaret
```

Let's test `printResult` with a dummy error value:

```fsharp {src=#printResult_withPosition_test}
let exampleError =
  Failure ("identifier", "unexpected |",
    {currentLine = "123 ab|cd"; line=1; column=6})

printResult exampleError
```

The output is shown below:

```text  {src=#printResult_withPosition_out}
Line:1 Col:6 Error parsing identifier
123 ab|cd
  ^unexpected |
```

Much nicer than before!

### Fixing up the `run` function

The `run` function now needs to take an `InputState` not a string.  But we also want the convenience of running against string input, so let's create two `run` functions, one that takes an `InputState` and one that takes a `string`:

```fsharp {src=#runOnInput}
/// Run the parser on a InputState
let runOnInput parser input =
  // call inner function with input
  parser.parseFn input

/// Run the parser on a string
let run parser inputStr =
  // call inner function with input
  runOnInput parser (InputState.fromStr inputStr)
```

### Fixing up the combinators

We now have three items in the `Failure` case rather than two. This breaks some code but is easy to fix. I'm tempted to create a special `ParserError` type so that it never happens again, but for now, I'll just fix up the errors.

Here's a new version of `satisfy`:

```fsharp {src=#satisfy_withPosition}
/// Match an input token if the predicate is satisfied
let satisfy predicate label =
  let innerFn input =
    let remainingInput,charOpt = InputState.nextChar input
    match charOpt with
    | None ->
      let err = "No more input"
      let pos = parserPositionFromInputState input
      //Failure (label,err)     // <====== old version
      Failure (label,err,pos)   // <====== new version
    | Some first ->
      if predicate first then
        Success (first,remainingInput)
      else
        let err = sprintf "Unexpected '%c'" first
        let pos = parserPositionFromInputState input
        //Failure (label,err)     // <====== old version
        Failure (label,err,pos)   // <====== new version
  // return the parser
  {parseFn=innerFn;label=label}
```

Note that the failure case code is now `Failure (label,err,pos)` where the parser position is built from the input state.

And here is `bindP`:

```fsharp {src=#bindP_withPosition}
/// "bindP" takes a parser-producing function f, and a parser p
/// and passes the output of p into f, to create a new parser
let bindP f p =
  let label = "unknown"
  let innerFn input =
    let result1 = runOnInput p input
    match result1 with
    | Failure (label,err,pos) ->     // <====== new with pos
      // return error from parser1
      Failure (label,err,pos)
    | Success (value1,remainingInput) ->
      // apply f to get a new parser
      let p2 = f value1
      // run parser with remaining input
      runOnInput p2 remainingInput
  {parseFn=innerFn; label=label}
```

We can fix up the other functions in the same way.

### Testing the positional errors

Let's test with a real parser now:

```fsharp {src=#none}
let parseAB =
    pchar 'A' .>>. pchar 'B'
    <?> "AB"

run parseAB "A|C"
|> printResult
```

And the output is:

```text {src=#none}
// Line:0 Col:1 Error parsing AB
// A|C
//  ^Unexpected '|'
```

Excellent!  I think we can stop now.

## 4. Adding some standard parsers to the library

In the previous posts, we've built parsers for strings and ints in passing, but now let's add them to the core library, so that clients don't have to reinvent the wheel.

These parsers are based on those in the [the FParsec library](http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/reference/charparsers.html#).

Let's start with some string-related parsers. I will present them without comment -- I hope that the code is self-explanatory by now.

```fsharp {src=#standardParsers}
/// parse a char
let pchar charToMatch =
  // label is just the character
  let label = sprintf "%c" charToMatch

  let predicate ch = (ch = charToMatch)
  satisfy predicate label

/// Choose any of a list of characters
let anyOf listOfChars =
  let label = sprintf "anyOf %A" listOfChars
  listOfChars
  |> List.map pchar // convert into parsers
  |> choice
  <?> label

/// Convert a list of chars to a string
let charListToStr charList =
  String(List.toArray charList)

/// Parses a sequence of zero or more chars with the char parser cp.
/// It returns the parsed chars as a string.
let manyChars cp =
  many cp
  |>> charListToStr

/// Parses a sequence of one or more chars with the char parser cp.
/// It returns the parsed chars as a string.
let manyChars1 cp =
  many1 cp
  |>> charListToStr

/// parse a specific string
let pstring str =
  // label is just the string
  let label = str

  str
  // convert to list of char
  |> List.ofSeq
  // map each char to a pchar
  |> List.map pchar
  // convert to Parser<char list>
  |> sequence
  // convert Parser<char list> to Parser<string>
  |> mapP charListToStr
  <?> label
```

Let's test `pstring`, for example:

```fsharp {src=#pstring_test}
run (pstring "AB") "ABC"
|> printResult
// "AB"

run (pstring "AB") "A|C"
|> printResult
// Line:0 Col:1 Error parsing AB
// A|C
//  ^Unexpected '|'
```

### Whitespace parsers

Whitespace is important in parsing, even if we do end up mostly throwing it away!

```fsharp {src=#WhitespaceParsers}
/// parse a whitespace char
let whitespaceChar =
  let predicate = Char.IsWhiteSpace
  let label = "whitespace"
  satisfy predicate label

/// parse zero or more whitespace char
let spaces = many whitespaceChar

/// parse one or more whitespace char
let spaces1 = many1 whitespaceChar
```

And here's some whitespace tests:

```fsharp {src=#WhitespaceParsers_test}
run spaces " ABC"
|> printResult
// [' ']

run spaces "A"
|> printResult
// []

run spaces1 " ABC"
|> printResult
// [' ']

run spaces1 "A"
|> printResult
// Line:0 Col:0 Error parsing many1 whitespace
// A
// ^Unexpected 'A'
```

### Numeric parsers

Finally, we need a parser for ints and floats.

```fsharp {src=#NumericParsers}
/// parse a digit
let digitChar =
  let predicate = Char.IsDigit
  let label = "digit"
  satisfy predicate label

// parse an integer
let pint =
  let label = "integer"

  // helper
  let resultToInt (sign,digits) =
    let i = digits |> int  // ignore int overflow for now
    match sign with
    | Some ch -> -i  // negate the int
    | None -> i

  // define parser for one or more digits
  let digits = manyChars1 digitChar

  // an "int" is optional sign + one or more digits
  opt (pchar '-') .>>. digits
  |> mapP resultToInt
  <?> label

// parse a float
let pfloat =
  let label = "float"

  // helper
  let resultToFloat (((sign,digits1),point),digits2) =
    let fl = sprintf "%s.%s" digits1 digits2 |> float
    match sign with
    | Some ch -> -fl  // negate the float
    | None -> fl

  // define parser for one or more digits
  let digits = manyChars1 digitChar

  // a float is sign, digits, point, digits (ignore exponents for now)
  opt (pchar '-') .>>. digits .>>. pchar '.' .>>. digits
  |> mapP resultToFloat
  <?> label
```

And some tests:

```fsharp {src=#NumericParsers_test}
run pint "-123Z"
|> printResult
// -123

run pint "-Z123"
|> printResult
// Line:0 Col:1 Error parsing integer
// -Z123
//  ^Unexpected 'Z'

run pfloat "-123.45Z"
|> printResult
// -123.45

run pfloat "-123Z45"
|> printResult
// Line:0 Col:4 Error parsing float
// -123Z45
//     ^Unexpected 'Z'
```

## 5. Backtracking

One more topic that we should discuss is "backtracking".

Let's say that you have two parsers: one to match the string `A-1` and and another to match the string `A-2`. If the input is `A-2` then the first parser will fail at the third character and the second parser will be attempted.

Now the second parser must start at the *beginning* of the original sequence of characters, not at the third character. That is, we need to undo the current position in the input stream and go back to the first position.

If we were using a mutable input stream then this might be a tricky problem, but thankfully we are using immutable data, and so "undoing" the position just means using the original input value. And of course, this is exactly what combinators such as `orElse` (`<|>`) do.

In other words, we get backtracking "for free" when we use immutable input state. Yay!

Sometimes however, we *don't* want to backtrack. For example, let's say we have these parsers:

* let `forExpression` = the "for" keyword, then an identifier, then the "in" keyword, etc.
* let `ifExpression` = the "if" keyword, then an identifier, then the "then" keyword, etc.

and we then create a combined expression parser that chooses between them:

* let `expression` = `forExpression <|> ifExpression`

Now, if the input stream is `for &&& in something` then the `forExpression` parser will error when it hits the sequence `&&&`, because it is expecting a valid identifier. At this point we *don't* want to backtrack and try the `ifExpression` -- we want to show an error such as "identifier expected after 'for'".

The rule then is that: *if* input has been consumed successfully (in this case, the `for` keyword was matched successfully) then do *not* backtrack.

We're not going to implement this rule in our simple library, but a proper library like FParsec does implement this and also has support for [bypassing it when needed](http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/reference/primitives.html#members.attempt).

## Listing of the final parser library

The parsing library is up to 500 lines of code now, so I won't show it here, but you can download it using the link at the bottom of this post.

## Summary

In this post, we added better error handling and some more parsers.

Now we have everything we need to build a JSON parser! That will be the topic of the [next post](/posts/understanding-parser-combinators-4/).
