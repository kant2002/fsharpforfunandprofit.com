This page contains links to the slides and video from my talk "F# for C# Programmers".


Here's the blurb for the talk:

> Curious about F# and want to understand how is it different from C#?\
  \ In this talk, we'll look at the basics of coding in F#, and how functional programming differs from object-oriented programming. Along the way, there will be many examples showing the same code written in C# and F# so that you can see for yourself how the two languages differ in style and approach.
