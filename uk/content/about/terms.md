These terms and conditions form your agreement with this site (hereafter, the SITE) and ScottW (hereafter, ME).

By reading this site, you agree to the following:

* You acknowledge that this SITE is written by one person, ME, over many years as I was learning, and that many of the posts may be out-of-date, incomplete, or just plain wrong. You also acknowledge that the ME of today is not happy with many of the old posts but has been too lazy to update them. THEREFORE, you promise to always look at the timestamp on a post and, if it is ancient, bear that in mind when you read it.

* You recognize that this SITE is not a definitive source of information. In particular, you agree not to use anything on this SITE as an [argument from authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority).

* You agree to never uncritically use the techniques described on this SITE. This SITE is not responsible for damage, loss of income, or your bad code that you thought was cool at the time but you end up hating later.

* Some of the techniques on this SITE can be dangerous if [ingested carelessly](/posts/against-railway-oriented-programming/). If you are concerned that your monads have become free, please consult a physician.

* You acknowledge that this SITE is primarily targeted at beginner and intermediate functional programmers. You indemnify ME against any pain and suffering caused to you by being deprived of words such as "Endofunctor", "Coyoneda", and "Zygohistomorphic prepromorphism".

* You agree not to call ME a thought-leader or any similar derogatory term. You also agree that I am not your uncle.

Penalties for breaking this agreement may include, but are not limited to, writing "I heart Scaled Agile Framework" 1000 times, publicly announcing on all social media that no other framework will ever be as good as Enterprise JavaBeans, or presenting a talk at the International Conference on Functional Programming entitled "Why Visual Basic DESTROYS Haskell".
