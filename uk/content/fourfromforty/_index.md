This page contains links to the slides and code from my talk "Four Languages From Forty Years Ago".

Here's the blurb for the talk:

> The 1970's were a golden age for new programming languages, but do they have any relevance to programming today? Can we still learn from them?\
  \   In this talk, we'll look at four languages designed over forty years ago --- SQL, Prolog, ML, and Smalltalk --- and discuss their philosophy and approach to programming, which is very different from most popular languages today.\
  \ We'll come away with some practical principles that are still very applicable to modern development. And you might discover your new favorite programming paradigm!
